Elections.wtf : A Dynamic MVP for Nouniverse Representation
Tldr
Introducing Elections.wtf: Cheffo & Primordia's innovative MVP reshapes Nouniverse rep elections with a Prop.house twist

Description
Proposal Summary: We're thrilled to present Elections.wtf, a groundbreaking MVP concept by CHEFFO that revolutionizes the way representatives are elected and engaged within the Nouniverse. This innovative platform combines the excitement of prop.house-like experiences with a democratic process to nominate, elect, and empower representatives within each Nouns House for designated term limits.



Our All-Star Team: Elections.wtf is brought to you by Primordia, a powerhouse trio consisting of 0xHashbrown, delightfulabyss, and captaincrunch. This technical dream team will collaborate closely with FOODNOUNS founder CHEFFO, and core contributor Jesse Morningstar, to implement and scale this revolutionary concept.



Our Strategy: The MVP will be developed using a two-pronged approach. First, we'll adapt the existing Prop.house framework, as its data structure aligns seamlessly with our vision for the representatives election platform. Next, we'll introduce term limits and access control automation by integrating Hats Protocol, a DAO-native organizational tool. This custom-tailored structure will address Nouns' specific requirements and empower contributors with the context, authority, and accountability needed for success.



The Road Ahead: FOODNOUNS will be the first DAO to implement Elections.wtf, setting the stage for widespread adoption throughout the Nouns community. Get ready for a game-changing experience that will redefine the way we nominate, elect, and engage with our representatives in the Nouniverse!



Details: Elections.wtf revolutionizes voting in the NounsDAO and other DAOs by allowing communities to elect representatives, delegates, and candidates for various positions. It introduces term limits for healthy leadership rotation and enables Eth allocations for incentivizing and pre-funding elected groups. An Election Board of Representatives (EBR) ensures transparent representation, with communities initiating open ballots after electing a representative. The founding team aims to develop decentralized mechanisms for long-term sustainability, potentially moving towards an ElectionsDAO framework.
